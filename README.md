</div>

‚≠êÔ∏è **PRAD** is a large-scale periapical radiograph segmentation dataset, annotated and verified by two endodontists with over 10 years of clinical experience. It provides **nine anatomical-level segmentation labels**, including:
- Tooth
- Alveolar Bone (AB)
- Pulp
- Root Canal Filling (RCF)
- Denture Crown (DC)
- Dental Fillings (DF)
- Implant (IM)
- Orthodontic Devices (OD)
- Apical Periodontitis (AP)
  
‚≠êÔ∏è **PRAD** is designed to provide a **valuable supplement** to the dental deep learning community, addressing the data gap in periapical radiographs and **establishing benchmark models** to foster the thriving development of this field.

## üíæ Dataset

Due to copyright and commercial considerations, **the PRAD dataset will be partially available to the public through an application process**. If you wish to use the PRAD dataset, please follow the procedure below to submit the application form for our review and processing:
- Please download the application form [`PRAD_application.pdf`](./figs) from this repository, complete it with your basic information, affiliated institution, and the purpose of using PRAD, and provide an official seal or signature.
- Please compose an email with the subject line `PRAD-application+Name+Institution`, attach the completed application form, and send it to `aics@nankai.edu.cn`.
- Once you have sent the email, **your application will formally enter the review process**. We will process your request as soon as possible, **with an estimated completion time of 14 working days**, so please plan accordingly. Upon approval, we will reply to your email with a download link and usage instructions for the PRAD dataset. **You will then be granted access to `5,000` images and their corresponding segmentation labels from PRAD.**
